<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Abdullah Fehim KILIÇARSLAN</h1>

<h3>About Me</h3>
I was born in May 2002 in Denizli. I first encountered computers and the internet at a young age. Since that day, I always aspired to have a profession related to computers, and I began to develop myself by constantly learning new things in areas such as hardware, operating systems, and more. I graduated from Denizli Anatolian Imam Hatip High School in 2020, and my interest in software began. I commenced my associate degree education in the Computer Programming department at Pamukkale University. My initial coding experience was with the Pascal language, and shortly after, I started working on projects using Python, C#, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, and more. In 2022, I began a 14-week workplace training at DESKİ (Denizli Water and Sewerage Administration) Information Technology Department Software Support Unit. During this time, I gained project experience using various programming languages and frameworks, continually improving my skills. After completing my workplace training in June 2022, I concluded my associate degree education with an academic average of 3.52. Since August 2022, I have been working as a full-stack developer at "BUPROJECT Development & Consultancy" company. Here, I continue to enhance my skills in various areas, including Python, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, Angular, data mining, web APIs, databases, and more.
